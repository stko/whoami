# Who Am I
A little fun project implementing a multiplayer interface for the popular "Who Am I" game

see it working online on https://stko-whoami.glitch.me

## Usage
The players sit all together. The first one logs into the a.m. website, entering his name (which is stored locally in his browser), starts a new game and shares it with the share button with the other players (alternatively tells the game ID to the other)

After also logging in, all players can see each other in the table. By tap onto another players name, a player can give a new identity to the other player.

All players can see these assignments, but not the affected player himself.

Now the game can start.

With the "Restart Game" button all entries are reseted and the game can go into the next round.

## Technics
This game is an interesting mix of the great glitch server platform, some good python webserver (supporting both normal http and websocket on the same port!) and the jquery mobile API for the web frontend

This game was programmed while laying at the pool on the Disney Fantasy Ship doing a cruise between Florida, Mexico and the Bahamas.
